Welcome to my website! 

I am a so-called "theoretical physicist" and my job is to study the Universe. 
I'm from Lisbon, in sunny Portugal, where I started out my journey at Instituto Superior Técnico (UL)
before moving to London to get my MSc at Imperial College and then Liverpool for my PhD. 
I am currently in Madrid, doing a postdoc at the Instítuto de Física Teórica (IFT).

Apart from doing research, I'm very also very interested in outreach and science communication, which is something I hope to do more in the future.

My work is mainly focused on String Theory and Cosmology. I am interested in connecting the high-energy physics of strings to the low-energy observations we want to explain: this includes for example the mysterious dark energy and dark matter that dominate the Universe around us (e.g. in the context of the debate around de Sitter vacua in string theory). I usually do this by exploring compactifications of the extra dimensions of string theory in the presence of things like fluxes and branes, which can have interesting effects -- an example is the warping that was the basis of my <a href="https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3171755/" target="_blank">PhD studies</a> in Liverpool. More recently I have started to think more carefully about the Swampland conjectures and their interplay with the familiar reasoning and intuition of Effective Field Theories. You can find more details on my research [here](./research/).
