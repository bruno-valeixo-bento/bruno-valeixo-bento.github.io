I am currently a postdoc at IFT, Madrid. I have done my PhD at the University of Liverpool, in the UK, on warped compactifications of Type IIB string theory. 
I am interested in string phenomenology, low-energy effective theories, the swampland program and cosmology. 

<!--- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
