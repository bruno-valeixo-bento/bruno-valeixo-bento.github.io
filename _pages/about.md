Welcome to my website! 

I am a theoretical physicist interested in the workings and mysteries of the Universe. 
I'm from Lisbon, in sunny Portugal, where I started out my journey at Intituto Superior Técnico (UL) -- that's where I confirmed my suspicion that my job would be to ask and answer the deepest questions about nature.

So I moved to London to get my Masters at Imperial College, which allowed me to meet incredible people and discover an amazing city. It is also how I ended up in beautiful Liverpool a year later to do my PhD. Now I am in Madrid as a postdoc at the Instítuto de Física Teórica (IFT) and my job is indeed to ask and answer questions about the Universe.

My work is mainly on String Theory and Cosmology. I am interested in connecting the high-energy physics of strings to the low-energy observations we want to explain: this includes for example the mysterious dark energy and dark matter that dominate the Universe around us. I usually do this by exploring compactifications of the extra dimensions of string theory in the presence of things like fluxes and branes, which can have interesting effects -- an example is the warping that was the basis of my <a href="https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3171755/" target="_blank">PhD studies</a> in Liverpool. More recently I have started to think more carefully about the Swampland conjectures and their interplay with the familiar reasoning and intuition of Effective Field Theories.
